I finally bought a domain & started my website. 

I built this site with a static-site generator called **Jekyll.** It’s pretty dope. You can find a LOT of open-source themes and integrate them into your website.  

I’m a *simple* backend developer who wanted to write stuff and didn’t want to deal with much of the frontend stuff. I just wanted a non-fancy static site and Jekyll (and open source themes) did the job pretty well. 

It had themes that looked pretty good - and after many hours of theme hunting, I shortlisted and finalized [this](https://github.com/kronik3r/daktilo). I’m gonna throw away all the contenders over here and save you some time - if you’re a person who doesn’t want something too fancy. 

And if you want to go down the rabbit hole where you choose a theme: [http://jekyllthemes.org/](http://jekyllthemes.org/) - is where I was roaming for hours. 

Here we go: 

**Contender 1: [Daktilo](https://github.com/kronik3r/daktilo)** 

Demo page: **[daktilo.github.io/](http://daktilo.github.io/)**

This is the one which I went with. Loved it! Don’t forget to check out the 404 page (the only thing not so simple in it. 

**Contender 2: [Ed](https://github.com/minicomp/ed)**

Demo page: **[minicomp.github.io/ed/](https://minicomp.github.io/ed/)**

Almost went through with this but felt too literature-y for the content I was going to put up here. 

**Contender 3:  [Chalk](https://github.com/nielsenramon/chalk)**

Demo page: **[http://chalk.nielsenramon.com/](http://chalk.nielsenramon.com/)**

Was pretty decent too. 

**Contender 4: [No Style Please](https://github.com/riggraz/no-style-please)**

Demo page: [https://riggraz.dev/no-style-please/](https://riggraz.dev/no-style-please/) 

This was a little too simple for me - but nonetheless, I liked it.

Okay, this was *the* post - a very short one. Thanks for reading!
